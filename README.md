# Carwings

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/joeshaw/carwings?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/joeshaw/carwings)

`carwings` is a Go package and command-line tool providing access to
the Nissan Leaf Carwings API.

Through the Carwings API you can ask your vehicle for the latest data,
see current battery and charging statuses, see the current climate
control state, start or stop climate control remotely, remotely
start charging, and retrieve the last known location of the vehicle.

## Command-line tool

The `carwings` tool can be installed with:

    go get github.com/joeshaw/carwings/cmd/carwings

Run `carwings` by itself to see full usage information.

To update vehicle information:

    carwings -username <username> -password <password> update

To get latest battery status:

    carwings -username <username> -password <password> battery

This will print something like:

    Logging into Carwings...
    Getting latest retrieved battery status...
    Battery status as of 2017-08-06 15:43:00 -0400 EDT:
      Capacity: 240 / 240 (92%)
      Crusing range: 114 mi (107 mi with AC)
      Plug-in state: not connected
      Charging status: not charging
      Time to full:
        Level 1 charge: 8h30m0s
        Level 2 charge: 3h0m0s
        Level 2 at 6 kW: 2h30m0s

For some people the username is an email address.  For others it's a
distinct username.

Usernames and passwords can also be provided through the environment
variables `CARWINGS_USERNAME`, `CARWINGS_PASSWORD` and `CARWINGS_REGION`
or in a `~/.carwingsrc` file in the format:

```
username=<username>
password=<password>
region=<eu|au|jp|ca|us>
sessionfile=<filename for saving sessions>
units=<km|miles>
```

If the `sessionfile` is set in the configuration then the session data will be
read from that file, if present, and written to it if it is missing.
